prosecutors in the ross case michael e ohara supervisory assistant states attorney for the state of connecticut wrote a 12page letter to the u s senate judiciary committee to elaborate upon the complaint that was filed and dismissed in 20052006 stating that judge chatignys actions certainly call into questions sic judge chatignys fitness to serve on the united states court of appeals for the

three republican former appointees as us attorney for the district of connecticut who said in a letter to the judiciary committee in april 2010 that they support without any reservation this nomination they wrote while each of us has dealt with judge chatigny under different circumstances we have found him to be even tempered thorough and without agenda we believe that he is a fair minded and impartial judge who has appropriate fitness and temperament for the appellate court we believe that a close examination of judge chatignys record in sentencing federal criminal defendants shows that he is appropriately sensitive to the facts of the person before him and the rights of victims of the crimes that have been committed indeed it is our understanding that the government has never filed an appeal from judge chatignys sentencings and that there has only been one defendant who has appealed from an upward departure we are of the strong opinion that judge chatignys record on the bench makes him an outstanding and very qualified candidate seventeen former federal prosecutors who have worked with judge chatigny wrote to the senate judiciary committee that in criminal as well as civil matters judge chatigny has proven himself over the course of 15 years on the bench to be unbiased compassionate and temperatein its 2006 dismissal of charges in the ross case the second circuit judicial council found that judge chatignys actions were not motivated by any bias in favor of ross the prisoner or against the death penalty but only by the judges reasonable perception that the discharge of his own judicial dutyrequired that he take forceful steps on rosss behalf while the judge used strong language there was no misconductin the judges reasonable view the circumstances thrust on him called for unusual action in discharge of judicial duty to ensure the fair resolution of the important proceeding before himchatigny has yet to rule on the appeal of former yale professor james van de velde who had sued the city of new haven in 2001 then yale in 2003 for allowing his name to be leaked at the inception of the investigation into the death of yale student

portuguesespeaking spokesperson of the yanomami indians in brazil he came to international prominence for this advocacy regarding tribal issues and amazon rainforest conservation when the tribal rights organization survival international invited him to accept the right livelihood award on its behalf in 1989 davi spoke to both the british and swedish parliaments about the catastrophic impact on yanomami health as a consequence of the illegal invasion of their land by 40000 garimpeiros or goldminers prince charles publicly called the situation genocide in a sevenyear period from 19871993 one fifth of the yanomami died from malaria and other diseases transmitted by the minersof all yanomami who have emerged as public figures probably the most important is davi kopenawa yanomami davi kopenawa was born near the rio toototobi near the border of venezuela he learned portuguese from a christian mission run by new tribes mission an american evangelical organization specializing in the proselytization of isolated peoples the acquisition of portuguese language proficiency then rare among the yanomami enabled davi kopenawa to interact with brazils lusophone majority both directly and through the mass mediain his own words translated from portuguesei know that the authorities and many people came here because the planet is sick and they are trying to find out how to cure it the people who come from many places from the other side of the big lake all come here to learn about how we live i want to speak giving the message from omai omai is the creator of the yanomami who also has created all the shaboris that are the shamans the shaboris are the ones that have the knowledge and they sent two of us to deliver their message the message is to stop destruction to stop taking out minerals from under the ground to stop taking out the steel with which all the metal utensils are made and to stop building roads we feel that a lot of riches have already been taken out of the indigenous lands and a lot of these riches are getting old and useless and it would be much better if the brazilian government would give these riches to the poor in brazil our work is to protect nature the wind the mountains the forest the animals and this is what we want to teach you peopledavi kopenawa is the soninlaw of another traditional tribal leader with whom he apprenticed to be a shaman his wife lost much of her family to measles and other diseases brought to the area in the 1970s by road construction crews and garimpeiros smalltime gold miners davi kopenawa has mentioned this as part of his personal motivation to speak out on his peoples behalf davi was orphaned as a child when his parents died from diseases transmitted by outsidersafter some months of staying on our territory they started to transmit malaria to us that means that the garimpeiros were already sick mosquitos bit the garimpeiros and then bit us that is how we got the disease the garimpeiros also brought in other diseases there are complications of pneumonia sometimes associated with malaria tuberculosis skin diseases that often are associated with other diseases and especially in children can be fatal there was an epidemic of yellow fever in the area hepatitis in the 1980s he began working for the brazilian government organization fundao nacional do ndio funai at a post in demini in the center of yanomami territory as an intermediary between the government and indigenous peoples with whom outsiders had little or no contact he also accompanied health workers to yanomami villages and has worked closely with organizations such as comisso pryanomami ccpy and survival international in the fight for the integrity of yanomami lands in brazilsince the invasion of yanomami territory began in 1987 by illegal goldminers davi kopenawa has worked for their removal from the area and for the creation of a parkland therein his action resulted in death threats from the miners and an award from the united nations environment programme in 1988 after a major international campaign led by davi survival international and ccpy the brazilian government finally recognized yanomami land rights in 1992 just before the uns earth summitdavi kopenawas unique role among his people has been commented on skeptically even by those sympathetic to him and his cause anthropologist napoleon chagnon wrote regarding davi kopenawa his nonyanomam supporters in brazil intelligent and wellintentioned advocates of the yanomam cause are promoting him as a spokesman for his people such a role exists largely because our culture must deal with other cultures through their leaders it is the only way we know how to deal with them everything i know about davi kobenaw is positive and i am confident that he is a sincere and honest man when i read his proclamations i am moved but i am also sure thatsomeone from our culture wrote them they have too much the voice of rousseaus idealism and sound very nonyanomam my concern is that he is being put into a difficult position fraught with consequences for the future of the yanomam for one thing there is currently no such thing as a panyanomam awareness and so he cannot possibly be speaking for the venezuelan yanomamsurvival international and many others with extensive experience of the yanomami have severely criticized chagnons work which portrays the yanomami as sly aggressive and intimidating and falsely claims that they live in a state of chronic warfare this characterization has undoubtedly been detrimental for them it was referred to by the brazilian government when it planned to fragment yanomami land in 1988 in a proposal which would have been catastrophic for the indians and which was only prevented by a vigorous campaignchagnons views in this matter were criticized by investigative journalist patrick tierney in his muchdefamed book darkness in el doradodavi has spoken out for over 20 years and visited many countries with his message about the importance of respecting indigenous peoples rights and their fundamental and unique role in conserving rainforest for the benefit of humanityin 2004 davi and other yanomami in brazil set up an organization called hutukara to defend their rights as well as advocating for yanomami rights it runs educational projects where yanomami teachers work in the communities teaching literacy maths geography and human rightsdavi continues to speak out about the dangers facing the yanomami he has warned about the impact large scale mining will have on the yanomami if the brazilian congress votes to allow mining on indigenous landswe the yanomami people think that mining will not bring any benefits to anyone it will only destroy nature it will only destroy the streams and the rivers and kill the fish and kill the environment and kill us and bring in diseases which never existed in our land it will bring roads and people who will bring in disease guns and violence so we the yanomami people do not want the national congress to approve the law or the president to sign it we do not want to accept this law our land has to be respected our land is our heritage a heritage which protects us this land belongs to us so that we can plant hunt be healthy it is our home where will live for the rest of our livesin 2009 he was honoured by the bartolome
